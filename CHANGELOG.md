# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Recover long sessions when Zen rotates backends: retry once without replayed `reasoning.encrypted_content` on `was not issued to this caller` / `could not be verified` 400s, dropping orphaned function-call ids to avoid pairing validation.

## 0.1.0

- Connect Pi directly to OpenCode Zen's anonymous free tier.
- Support Muse Spark images, configurable thinking, streaming, and native tool calls.
- Register other known free models through Pi's native Chat Completions transport.
- Refresh available models against Zen's public catalogue while retaining Pi's model metadata.
- Keep session routing stable without sending API credentials.
